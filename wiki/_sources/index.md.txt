**AzerothCore Module: Quest Status**

- Latest build status with azerothcore

[![Build Status](https://github.com/pangolp/mod-quest-status/workflows/core-build/badge.svg?branch=master&event=push)](https://github.com/pangolp/mod-quest-status)

**What is the module for?**

It aims to assist the players, who eliminate quests and then don't know where in the chain they stayed. Focused mainly on reputational chains. You can make a macro with all the missions of a chain and inspect the player to know which one is missing. The module is a modification of the mission inspection command, but instead of searching by name, it searches by id, making the search much more precise.
